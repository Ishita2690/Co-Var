For intra-protein analysis run the following scripts in order. Results will be generated in output directory specified. Summary of results can be viewed in the browser by opening the file 'getIntraRes.html'

./wrapper-combi-Intra [sequence/alignment file] [input type] [threshold] [output dir]

./strucresAnal [PDB file (Reference structure)] [chain ID (Reference structure)] [sequence/alignment file] [threshold] [output dir] [PDB ID]

Input options:
[sequence/alignment file] = /path/to/file/workingDir/filename.fa
[PDB file (Reference structure)] = /path/to/file/workingDir/file.pdb
[input type] = sequence or msa
[threshold] = z-score threshold (default: -1)
[output dir] = workingDir
[PDB ID] = PDB code of reference structure
