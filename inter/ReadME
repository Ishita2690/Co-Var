For inter-protein analysis run the following scripts in order. Results will be generated in output directory specified. Summary of results can be viewed in the browser by opening the file 'ResInterProt.html'

./wrapper-combi-Inter [sequence/alignment file (Family A)] [sequence/alignment file (Family B)] [input type] [threshold] [output dir]

./strucresAnal-IP  [Reference structure PDB file]  [chain ID of reference sequence A] [chain ID of reference sequence B]  [input sequence/alignment file (family A)]  [input sequence/alignment file (family B)] [threshold] [output dir] [PDB id] [distance threshold]


Input options:
[sequence/alignment file] = /path/to/file/workingDir/filename.fa
[Reference structure PDB file] = /path/to/file/workingDir/file.pdb
[input type] = sequence or msa
[threshold] = z-score threshold (default: -1)
[output dir] = working Directory 
[PDB ID] = PDB code of reference structure
